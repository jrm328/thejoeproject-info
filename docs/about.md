# About The Joe Project

Hi! I’m Joe — just a guy with too many hobbies and not enough time.

I started **The Joe Project** as a way to document, share, and celebrate the creative rabbit holes I dive into. Whether I’m modding my Steam Deck, designing a 3D-printed arcade cabinet, or just figuring out a better way to store cables, this site is where it all lives.

## 🧰 What I Love Doing

- Tinkering with gadgets and gear
- Printing weird, useful, or just fun things
- Playing and streaming games (and sometimes building stuff live)
- Sharing what I learn as I go — the wins *and* the screw-ups

## 🧭 Why This Exists

This wiki isn’t just a build log — it’s a creative outlet.  
It’s for folks like me who love making stuff, solving problems, and trying things just to see if they’ll work.

## 🤝 Get Involved

Have an idea? Want to remix one of my builds? Just want to say hi?
