# Welcome to The Joe Project

> *“Just a guy with too many hobbies and not enough time.”*

Welcome to my project wiki — a home for all the things I make, tinker with, or obsess over for way too long.  
This site is a living archive of my personal builds, mods, experiments, and creative chaos.

## 🔧 What You'll Find Here

- **3D Printing Projects** – Custom accessories, prototypes, tools, and display pieces.
- **Gadget Hacks** – Steam Deck mods, DIY electronics, and watch rebuilds.
- **Creative Builds** – From mini arcade machines to laser-cut puzzles.
- **Links to Downloads** – STL files, code snippets, and how-to diagrams.

If you’re looking for polished instructions or deep dives, check out [TheJoeProject.info](https://thejoeproject.info) — this wiki will point you there when needed.
